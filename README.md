# brick
"Being a human means having limits. The more carefully you scheme, the more unexpected cost of time comes along."

Brick is a text insertion program mainly for CSCE629's Latex homework.

The program read an .tex file and generate a template to save you some time.

You can add stuffs to the template.txt to DIY your template in a certain degree.

There are several design drawbacks needed to be done, like keyward detection function is not sufficient for solution template insertion.

# how to use
If you are using an IDE, make sure the PATH constant in program is corrent.

Other than that, put your homework, the program and template into the same directory first.

Run the program.
  One way to do that is: using `javac brick`  and `java brick` in terminal.
